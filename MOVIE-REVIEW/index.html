<h2>PLOT</h2>
<hr>

	<p>Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Ranchoddas "Rancho" Chanchad (Aamir Khan) are students and roommates at the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. This movie addresses two major issues in the society: one is the issues associated with the present day education system in India, particularly in Engineering colleges, and the other is parental pressure on children to pursue specific careers like that in engineering.<br><br>

Rancho believes in hands on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, coming into conflict with professors, in particular with the institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe or "Virus" (Boman Irani), whose traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur Ramalingam, nicknamed “Silencer,” is an arrogant Ugandan-born Tamil student who is obsessed with standing first in the exams. Rancho plays a prank on Chatur who is humiliated, and bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<hr>
	<p>Principal photography began on 28 July 2008. Hirani and his team left in late August for the shoot with the principal cast. The film was shot in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Ladakh, Chail and Shimla. Aamir and rest of the cast began shooting in early September. Hirani planned to wrap up the film by December. The first scene was shot in an aircraft with Madhavan. From Mumbai, the crew and cast comprising Aamir and Kareena went to Ladakh for a 20-day schedule.Filming of the ICE college scenes took place at the Indian Institute of Management  Bangalore campus for 33 days as a part of the second schedule of production.

The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people in India's backyards. The brains behind these innovations include Remya Jose, a student from Kerala, who created the pedal operated washing-machine;Mohammad Idris, a barber from Hasanpur Kalan in Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, who invented a bicycle-powered horse clipper; and Jahangir Painter, a painter from Maharashtra, who made the scooter-powered flour mill.The character Phunsuk Wangdu may have also drawn inspiration from Ladakhi inventor Sonam Wangchuk.</p>
